User: How does reverse proxy with authentication works?

A reverse proxy with authentication is one of the safest and most flexible ways to let only trusted devices or apps access your backend server — even if the backend is deployed publicly.

Here’s the simplest way to understand how it works:

🧱 Basic Flow
Without reverse proxy

Your devices → Backend API
(Anyone can hit your backend directly if they know the IP/URL)

With reverse proxy

Your devices → Reverse Proxy → Backend API
(Proxy checks auth FIRST; only approved requests reach your backend)

🔐 How Reverse Proxy + Authentication Works
1. A reverse proxy sits in front of your backend

Examples:

NGINX

Traefik

Apache

Cloudflare Zero Trust

Azure API Management

AWS API Gateway

This proxy becomes the only entry point to your backend.

Your backend becomes invisible — only the proxy is exposed.

2. Proxy intercepts every request

Before the request reaches your API, the proxy checks:

Does the request contain a valid API key?

Does it come from an authenticated user or device?

Does the device have a valid JWT?

Does it pass zero-trust rules?

If validation fails → the proxy BLOCKS the request.

Your backend never sees it.

3. If authentication succeeds

The reverse proxy forwards the request to:

http://localhost:5000/api/users


Your backend trusts the reverse proxy and doesn't need to expose itself to the internet.

🧿 Real-world example: NGINX Reverse Proxy + API Key
Client → NGINX → Backend

Step 1 – Client sends request with secret key

GET /api/projects
X-APP-KEY: my_frontend_secret


Step 2 – NGINX checks the key before forwarding

location /api/ {
    if ($http_x_app_key != "my_frontend_secret") {
        return 401;
    }

    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
}


If the key doesn't match → request is rejected instantly.

🔐 4. Bonus: You can add IP filtering, rate limit, JWT validation

Examples:

Allow only specific IP ranges

Require signed JWT tokens

Block brute-force

Add HTTPS enforcements

The reverse proxy becomes your security gate.

🛡️ Why people use Reverse Proxy with Auth
✔ Only authenticated clients reach backend
✔ Backend stays hidden and protected
✔ Add or remove security rules without touching backend code
✔ Prevent direct hacks on backend
✔ Can handle millions of requests efficiently
✔ Perfect for mobile apps, desktop apps, and web apps
📌 Real-world setup for YOU specifically

Since you're building:

.NET MAUI app

ASP.NET Core Web API

Mobile + desktop clients

Secret frontend key authentication

Your setup can be:

User Device → MAUI App → Reverse Proxy (NGINX/Cloudflare) → ASP.NET Core API

Authentication options for you:

Option A — Proxy requires your MAUI/desktop app to send a secret

(Your current plan)

Option B — Proxy requires JWT tokens

(More secure)

Option C — Cloudflare Zero Trust device-level authentication

(No one except your device can access backend)

User: Are there any possibility that when I use static IP address, that would be my permanent IP address whenever I go to anywhere that has Wi-Fi on it?

That’s a really smart question — and the short answer is:
👉 No, a static IP address on your home or office network does not automatically follow you wherever you connect to Wi-Fi.

But — let’s unpack why, and what you can do if you want a “fixed” IP identity anywhere.

🧩 Why Your Static IP Doesn’t Travel With You

When you connect to any Wi-Fi, your device is given a local IP from that router’s network (for example, 192.168.1.10 or 10.0.0.25).
That local IP is temporary and belongs to that specific Wi-Fi network, not to you personally.

Even if you have a static public IP from your internet provider at home (like 112.210.56.120), that IP:

belongs to your router’s internet connection,

not your laptop or phone itself.

So when you go to school, coffee shop, or another city, your device connects through a different router, which uses its own public IP address.
→ Therefore, your “home static IP” stays at home.

🌐 Ways to Have a Permanent IP “Everywhere”

If your goal is to have one fixed IP address no matter where you are (e.g., to identify yourself securely to your backend), you have a few realistic options:

🧱 Option 1 – Use a VPN server with static IP

You can:

Rent a VPN with a fixed public IP (e.g., from NordVPN, ProtonVPN, or Cloudflare Tunnel),

OR host your own WireGuard/OpenVPN server on your home router or a cloud VM (e.g., Azure, AWS, or Oracle Cloud).

➡️ When you connect your device to that VPN, all your traffic goes through it.
Your backend always sees the same public IP (your VPN’s IP), even if you’re on different Wi-Fi networks.

✅ Pros:

Same IP everywhere

Works on desktop & mobile

Secure, encrypted traffic

❌ Cons:

Requires VPN setup and connection

May slightly reduce internet speed

⚙️ Option 2 – Use a reverse proxy with key authentication (like you planned)

Instead of relying on IP addresses, your frontend (MAUI app) sends a secret key or token with every request.
Your backend validates that key before processing anything.

✅ Works anywhere, on any Wi-Fi
✅ Much easier to maintain
✅ No need to manage IP addresses
❌ If the key is leaked, someone could imitate your frontend — so use encryption & obfuscation in your MAUI app.

☁️ Option 3 – Use Cloudflare Zero Trust or API Gateway with client certificate

You can configure your backend to only accept traffic that:

Passes through your Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel, or

Includes a client certificate (like mutual TLS).

✅ Ultra-secure enterprise approach
✅ Device-based authentication
❌ More complex setup

🧠 TL;DR
Scenario	Static IP follows you?	Better Solution
You have static IP at home	❌ No	Use VPN with static IP
You want fixed identity for backend requests	❌ No	Use secret key or JWT
You want enterprise-level device security	❌ No	Use Cloudflare Zero Trust or mTLS

If you tell me your goal for the static IP (e.g., verifying frontend → backend connection, or securing admin-only access),
I can tell you which exact setup is the most practical for your case — including how to configure it for your .NET MAUI + ASP.NET Core Web API combo.

Would you like me to explain which one fits your case best?

User: If i use reverse proxy with key authentication, what should i do? What application or services that offers reverse proxy? Are there any free services for reverse proxy?

Great questions — and reverse proxy with key authentication is honestly one of the BEST choices for your setup (MAUI app + ASP.NET Core Web API).
Let me give you the full picture, including what to use, how to do it, and what's free.

🧱 1. What exactly do you need to do?

If you want to use reverse proxy + key authentication, your process is:

Step 1 — Choose a reverse proxy

This becomes the “gatekeeper” in front of your backend.

Step 2 — Configure it to require a secret key

Your MAUI app sends a header like:

X-App-Secret: your_very_long_secret_key_here


The reverse proxy checks this before forwarding the request to your backend.

Step 3 — Reverse proxy forwards allowed requests to ASP.NET Core

All rejected requests never reach your API.

This gives you:

❌ No direct access to backend

✔ Your backend IP stays hidden

✔ Only requests with the correct key get forwarded

🧱 2. What applications/services offer reverse proxy?

Here are the most popular reverse proxy systems:

🔵 Recommended for students (FREE / easy):
A. NGINX (Free, most popular, runs anywhere)

The gold standard.

You install it on:

Your VPS

Your cloud VM

Your local server

Even inside a Docker container

It becomes the single entry point and forwards requests to your backend.

B. Cloudflare + Cloudflare Tunnel (FREE)

This is the best free cloud reverse proxy solution.

You install cloudflared on your backend server, and Cloudflare creates a secure tunnel for you.

Features:

100% free

Reverse proxy is on Cloudflare

Hidden backend (no public exposure)

DDoS protection

Firewall rules

Header-based authentication

C. Traefik (Free, modern, cloud-native)

Traefik is easier than NGINX if you like Docker or container-based hosting.

🟣 Paid (but very professional):
● Azure API Management
● AWS API Gateway
● Google Cloud API Gateway
● Cloudflare Zero Trust Access

These are enterprise-grade but not really needed for you right now.

🧱 3. Free Reverse Proxy Options (with key authentication)

Here are the free solutions you can use right now:

🟩 Option 1 — NGINX (100% Free)
Example setup:

Client (MAUI app) → NGINX → ASP.NET Core API

Your app sends:

👉 Do you want Cloudflare Tunnel or NGINX?

User: If i use nginx, would it work on the local machine that has windows os?

Yes — NGINX works perfectly on Windows, and you can absolutely run it as a reverse proxy on your local Windows machine.

But there are a few important details you should know so you can decide if it's the right option.

✅ 1. Yes, NGINX Works on Windows

NGINX has a native Windows build.

You can download it directly from the official NGINX website:

It's a ZIP file

You extract it

Run nginx.exe

Done — it's running as a reverse proxy on Windows

You do NOT need Linux.

🧩 2. How NGINX works on Windows (important)

NGINX on Windows:

runs normally

supports reverse proxy

supports header authentication

supports SSL/TLS

supports forwarding requests to your ASP.NET Core API

Example:

MAUI App → NGINX (Windows) → ASP.NET Core API (localhost:5000)


This works smoothly.

⚠️ BUT — Windows NGINX has limitations

This is important:

NGINX on Windows:

is not optimized for high-performance production

can only use 1 worker process

may have slower I/O compared to Linux builds

So it’s GREAT for:

Local development

Personal server

Small hobby projects

Student use

Internal/private usage

But NOT ideal if:

You expect thousands of requests per second

You plan a large-scale project

For your capstone / MAUI app system → Windows NGINX is perfectly fine.

🧱 3. Your exact use case: Will it work?

You want:

Reverse proxy

Key authentication

Control over incoming requests

Secure frontend → backend

Local machine or student server

✔ NGINX on Windows works
✔ Reverse proxy works
✔ Key authentication works
✔ Hidden backend works
✔ MAUI app calling through NGINX works

So yes — it’s 100% good for your setup.

🧱 4. Example: NGINX config on Windows

Save this inside:

nginx/conf/nginx.conf

events {}

http {
    server {
        listen 8080;

        # Authentication by header
        if ($http_x_app_secret != "YOUR_SECRET_HERE") {
            return 403;
        }

        # Reverse proxy to your ASP.NET API
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        }
    }
}


Start NGINX:

nginx.exe


Now:

Your MAUI app calls:

http://yourmachineip:8080


NGINX checks your header → forwards to ASP.NET API.

🧱 5. Should you run it long-term on Windows?
✔ Yes — if it's for:

Student projects

Local machine

Windows desktop/server

Capstone systems

Internal systems

❌ No — if it's for:

High-traffic public systems

Enterprise-level deployment

For production, Linux NGINX is much better.

⭐ Final Answer

👉 YES. NGINX works on Windows and will work perfectly for your reverse proxy + key authentication setup.

User: You do know that i have a side project called ax vault: a multi-tenant password manager. This was supposed to be a multi-tenant manager IF there are someone who are interested to buy but as long as no one wants to buy the system, ill be using this as my personal password manager. So nginx would work here right?

Yes — NGINX is perfect for your AX Vault project, whether you keep it private for personal use or turn it into a multi-tenant system later.
Let me explain clearly and simply why it fits your case.

✅ 1. AX Vault (Password Manager) + NGINX = Great Match
You said:


AX Vault is a side project


For now it’s personal use


But could be multi-tenant in the future if someone buys it


You want a secure, controlled backend access method


You don’t want random devices hitting your API


NGINX helps with ALL of that:
✔ Acts as a security gate in front of your backend
✔ Adds authentication BEFORE requests reach AX Vault
✔ Lets only your device(s) communicate with the API
✔ Easy to configure and maintain
✔ Runs fine on Windows (your personal server)
✔ Zero cost
So yes — NGINX works perfectly for AX Vault.

🧱 2. Why NGINX is especially good for a password manager
For a password manager, security is everything.
NGINX gives you powerful features:
🛡 Reverse proxy
Your backend never exposes its real port, only NGINX does.
🔐 Header authentication
Your MAUI app sends a secret:
X-AxVault-Key: <secret>

NGINX checks this first.
If wrong → the backend never sees the request.
📡 TLS/SSL (HTTPS)
NGINX can handle SSL certificates to encrypt communication.
🚫 Shield against bots / scanners
NGINX blocks most malicious traffic before it hits your API.
📊 Rate limiting
Stop brute-force attacks.
🔁 Scalable
If someday AX Vault does get customers, NGINX can serve multi-tenant routes like:
/tenant1/api/
/tenant2/api/


🖥️ 3. Running NGINX on Windows for personal use is totally OK
While NGINX on Windows is not meant for huge enterprise load, it is MORE than enough for:


Your personal password manager


A few client devices


Occasional users if someone buys it


Development and testing


Light-to-medium usage


And it will run reliably on Windows 10/11 or Windows Server.

🧱 4. Typical AX Vault setup with NGINX (simple & secure)
MAUI App → NGINX (Windows) → AX Vault Backend API

NGINX config:
server {
    listen 8080;

    if ($http_x_axvault_key != "VERY_SECURE_KEY_HERE") {
        return 403;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000; # AX Vault API
    }
}

Your MAUI app must send:
X-AxVault-Key: VERY_SECURE_KEY_HERE


⭐ 5. For Personal Use: NGINX is even better
If AX Vault becomes your personal password manager, NGINX gives you:
✔ Secure tunnel
✔ Hidden API ports
✔ Strong authentication
✔ Lightweight performance
✔ Easy to install
✔ No need for static IP
✔ Compatible with your .NET MAUI app
It’s honestly one of the best setups for a personal backend.

🎯 Final Answer
YES. NGINX will work perfectly for your AX Vault project — both for personal use and future multi-tenant expansion.

User: So just to clarify, so NGINX has reverse proxy, right? So here's the big question. Ga sixkill mean an IP address? Because what I want to know is that whatever the IP address would be, the frontend can properly communicate to the backend itself.

Got it! So, the great thing about using NGINX as a reverse proxy is that it essentially sits in front of your backend and handles all the traffic. The IP address that the frontend uses to communicate with the backend can be the IP of the machine running NGINX. This means that even if the backend's IP changes or is hidden, the frontend will always communicate with the NGINX proxy. So, in other words, you don’t need to worry about the backend’s IP address changing, because the frontend will always talk to the stable NGINX address. It’s a very neat setup!

User: So you meant to say was that Nginx would be the proxy, right? So it means it would provide a proper static IP address before it would send gagay ka to the backend? Did I hear it right? Or like a gomeng name?

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely on the right track! So, NGINX acts as that middle layer, and it essentially provides a consistent entry point for your frontend. This means that the frontend will always communicate with the IP address or the domain name of the NGINX server, and then NGINX will forward the requests to your backend. This way, the backend’s IP can be kept private or dynamic, and you can even use a domain name for the NGINX server. It’s a really flexible and secure setup!

User: So let's say I would use a domain name on the Nginx. Is it free as long as it wasn't a custom domain? Like the Nginx would provide the domain name itself?

Got it! So, if you want to use a domain name with your NGINX setup, there are a couple of ways to do it:

1. **Free Subdomains**: Some services provide a free subdomain for you. For example, if you use a service like Cloudflare Tunnel (previously known as Argo Tunnel), it can give you a free subdomain under their domain. This means you don’t have to purchase a custom domain.

2. **Custom Domain**: If you want a custom domain (like `yourproject.com`), you’d need to register it through a domain registrar, and that usually comes with a yearly fee.

So, in short, if you just want something quick and free, using a subdomain from a service like Cloudflare is a great way to go. If you want a more professional look, then a custom domain is the way to go.

User: If i dont use domain name, would it mean that nginx would provide a considtent IP address then?

Short answer: No — NGINX does not provide a consistent IP address.
But don’t worry — I’ll explain clearly what does give you a consistent IP (and what doesn’t), so you know exactly how to set up your system.

Let’s break it down in the simplest way possible.

🧠 Important Clarification
❌ NGINX does NOT give you a static IP address.

NGINX is only a reverse proxy software.
It does not control your IP address.

Your IP address always comes from:

Your ISP (internet provider) → for public IP

Your router → for local network IP

NGINX only listens on whatever IP your machine already has.

So NGINX cannot make your IP “consistent.”

🧱 What NGINX does provide

NGINX gives you:

A consistent endpoint (port + URL path)

A single entry point for your frontend

A static gateway for your backend (even if backend IP changes)

Header authentication (your secret key)

Reverse proxy routing

But the IP itself still comes from your network.

💡 So how do people get a consistent entry point WITHOUT a domain name?

They use one of these options:

🟩 Option 1 — Use your local machine’s LAN IP (consistent inside your home)

Example:

192.168.1.5:8080


NGINX always listens on that IP (within your own local network).

✔ Works only at home
❌ Changes if your router gives a new IP
❌ Does not work outside your house

🟦 Option 2 — Use your public IP (only if your ISP gives static IP)

Examples:

112.210.154.22:8080


BUT:

Your public IP changes if you don’t pay for static IP

Prepaid/WiFi ISP usually gives dynamic IP

Mobile hotspot always gives CGNAT (no port forwarding)

So this only works if you pay for a static public IP.

🟨 Option 3 — Use a FREE Cloudflare Tunnel subdomain (recommended)

This solves your problem perfectly without buying a domain and without caring about your IP address.

Example free domain provided by Cloudflare Tunnel:

example-name.cloudflareTunnel.com


Benefits:

✔ 100% FREE

✔ Works anywhere

✔ Your IP can change anytime — still works

✔ No need static IP

✔ NGINX can run behind it

This is the best solution if you don’t want to buy a domain AND you don’t want to rely on your IP address.

🟧 Option 4 — Use Ngrok free domain (temporary only)

Example:

3b218a56.ngrok-free.app


✔ Free
❌ Changes every time you restart
❌ Not recommended for a password manager system

🟥 Option 5 — No domain, no static IP → Then you CANNOT have a consistent address

If:

You don’t pay for static public IP

You don’t use a domain

You don’t use Cloudflare Tunnel

You rely on your home internet

Then:

👉 Your IP will change randomly
👉 Your backend will be unreachable sometimes
👉 Your MAUI app cannot consistently connect

There is no way to avoid that.

⭐ FINAL ANSWER
NGINX does NOT provide you a consistent IP address.
NGINX only listens on whatever IP your machine already has.

If you want:

No domain

No paid static IP

Consistent access from anywhere

Then your BEST option is:

👉 Use Cloudflare Tunnel (free) to get a free, consistent subdomain

Even if your IP changes, your backend stays accessible.

If you want, I can show you:

✅ How to set up Cloudflare Tunnel with your Windows machine
✅ How to connect NGINX behind Cloudflare
✅ How to protect your backend with a secret key
✅ How your MAUI app should connect to it

Just tell me "Cloudflare Tunnel setup", and I'll guide you step-by-step.

User: But you did say that nginx can properly connect my frontend on physical android device to the local machine's backend regardless of different ip addresses right?

Great question — and let’s clear this up 100% correctly, because this part is very important.

⭐ Short Answer

NO — NGINX cannot magically let your Android device connect to your backend if your IP address keeps changing.
NGINX does NOT bypass IP changes.

BUT…

👉 NGINX can provide a consistent CONNECTION PATH between your frontend and backend — only if the Android device can reach the machine running NGINX.

That means:

✔ NGINX does NOT fix the IP problem
✔ NGINX DOES fix backend routing problems
✔ You STILL need a stable IP or stable domain/subdomain for the Android app to connect

Let me explain clearly.

🧠 What NGINX actually solves

NGINX fixes this problem:

“My backend has changing ports, addresses, or multiple services.”

Because NGINX becomes your single gateway:

Android → NGINX → Backend


This means:

Your MAUI app only talks to NGINX

Your backend can be moved, renamed, or changed internally

NGINX always forwards correctly

So routing is consistent.

But this is NOT related to IP address stability.

🧠 What NGINX cannot solve

NGINX does NOT solve this problem:

“I want to access my backend from anywhere even if my IP changes.”

Because NGINX still sits on your machine, which still has:

A local LAN IP

OR a public IP assigned by ISP

Both of which may change.

NGINX cannot override the IP your router or ISP gives you.

🟩 So when does NGINX work with an Android physical device?
✔ If both devices are on the SAME Wi-Fi:

Yes, it works perfectly.

Example:

Your PC: 192.168.1.10
Your Android: 192.168.1.7


Your Android can call:

http://192.168.1.10:8080


Even if your backend internally runs at:

http://localhost:5000


NGINX forwards it correctly.

This is when NGINX helps.

🟥 When NGINX does NOT help
❌ If devices are on DIFFERENT networks
❌ If your public IP changes
❌ If you switch Wi-Fi networks
❌ If your ISP changes your gateway IP
❌ If you're outside your home

Your Android will NOT connect unless:

You have static IP, or

You use a DNS/domain, or

You use Cloudflare Tunnel, or

You use Ngrok, or

You use another tunneling service

NGINX alone does NOT solve external connectivity.

⭐ REAL ANSWER to Your Question

“Can NGINX connect my Android app to my backend regardless of different IP addresses?”

❌ NO — IP changes still break connectivity.
✔ YES — as long as the device can still reach NGINX's IP.

Connectivity depends on IP.
Routing depends on NGINX.

Different problems.

🧩 So what's the correct solution for you?

Since your goal is:

“My Android MAUI app should always connect to my backend EVEN if the IP changes.”

Then the right solution is:

⭐ Cloudflare Tunnel (free) or a real domain name

This gives you a stable endpoint like:

https://example-tunnel.cloudflare.com


And that ALWAYS points to your machine
—even if your IP changes
—even if you switch networks
—even if you're behind NAT

NGINX + Cloudflare Tunnel = 🔥 best setup

👍 Final Summary
Feature	NGINX	Solves IP Problem?
Reverse proxy	✔ Yes	❌ No
Secure routes	✔ Yes	
Consistent gateway	✔ Yes	
Provide static IP	❌ No	
Keep connection working even if your home IP changes	❌ No	

So NGINX helps with routing and security, but NOT with IP stability.

If you want, I can explain how:

MAUI app connects to a Cloudflare Tunnel URL

NGINX runs behind the Tunnel

Your backend stays private

IP changes don’t matter anymore
